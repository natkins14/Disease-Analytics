# Disease Analytics with Life Expectancy Data

This project explores global life expectancy data related to measles incidence.  
Using machine learning and data science techniques, the project builds predictive models and visualizations to examine the impact of disease on population health.  

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Predictive modeling with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Training and testing with split datasets  
- Visualization of correlations between measles and life expectancy  

## Technologies
- Python  
- TensorFlow, Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: 
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook YouTubeDataViz.ipynb
